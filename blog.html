<p>Everyone always talks about what AI actually is, so let's break it down. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence where artificial means made or produced by humans and intelligence means the ability to think and or learn. When you put it into simpler terms, AI is a machine that is able to do many tasks that humans do in their day to day lives. AI works by collecting data, learning information, uses decision making skills, and finally gives us its feedback. We can see it everywhere today. Although it has been around for over 50 years, it is now being more commonly used as time goes by. We mostly started to pay attention to it in 2020-2023.</p>
<p>There are many different ways AI can or is currently being used in the world. The way it works is that it first collects the data. When you ask a question to any AI like ChatGpt or Copilot, it tries to understand what you are asking them. For example if you ask “What is the biggest country in the world?” The first thing that it's going to do is gather all your information. It is then going to proceed to look on the web and get every possible article or book that has to do with countries. Then it's going to learn or process what you are talking about and what the internet is saying. It's finally going to give you an answer. Another example is w=hen you ask Alexa to play a random song, the information you gave it was to play a random song, so that's what Alexa is typically going to do.</p>
<p>It can also be used as a problem solving technique. AI is created in the field of computer science, but can be used in many other fields also, like Medical or media/entertainment. An example of this is trying to diagnose someone with a disease. You can now use a device generated by AI for that depending on the disease. As more time goes by, AI is becoming more influential and is being used more often by many people including teachers or kids on a daily basis. It does not matter the importance of the question, you can ask it little things like “How do you draw a fish?” to things like “Is there a cure for cancer?" 
AI has a lot of pros as you see above, but it can also have many cons like most stuff. Some of those cons are that people might rely too much on stuff like chatgpt to do all their work. That actually hurts people more than it helps them. Also AI is not always right and it makes mistakes just like humans do. Another problem is that if people use it too much, they lose their sense of creativity. When you copy something from AI every single time you have a question, that makes you dependent on it and just becomes a habit. AI can also make mistakes if it learns from bad or unfair information. Yes, you can use AI for help on some problems, but you should not use it for everything in your life.
Some people worry that machines might take over jobs that humans do. Another challenge is privacy, because AI often uses personal data to make decisions
Overall, AI is an ever changing thing that is making the world a better and not better place to live. It helps us think about stuff in different ways, but can also be hurtful if we as humans don't use it correctly. The future of AI is not just about machines, but for the better of the planet.Artificial Intelligence is one of the most powerful tools humans have created. It can make life easier, faster, and smarter. But it’s important to use AI wisely and fairly. If we guide it carefully, AI could help build a better future for everyone.</p>

      <h2>What is Science</a></h2>
      <p>What is Science: We are covering only 3 types of science here:

What are the 3 types of sciences-

Science is one of the most important ways humans understand the world. It helps us discover new things, solve problems, and answer questions. Among the many branches of science, there are 3 main types. Chemistry, Biology, and Physics. Each has a similar yet extremely different purpose. These three stand out as the foundation of natural science. Each of these subjects focuses on different aspects of the world.



Chemistry is the study of matter and talks about everything that has mass and takes up space [1]. Chemists explore how substances are made, how they interact, and how they change. For example, when you mix vinegar and baking soda, a chemical reaction produces bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. Chemistry explains why metals rust, why ice melts, and how medicines are created.Chemistry is everywhere in daily life. Cooking is full of chemistry: when bread rises, yeast produces carbon dioxide; when meat browns, chemical reactions change its flavor. Cleaning products, fuels, plastics, and even the air we breathe are all studied through chemistry. On a larger scale, chemistry helps scientists design new materials, discover cures for diseases, and protect the environment by studying pollution and climate change.
Physics is the science of energy, motion, and forces [2]. It explains the fundamental laws of the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies. Sports rely on physics—when a soccer ball is kicked, the force, speed, and angle determine how far it goes. Roller coasters use physics to balance gravity and motion, giving riders thrills while staying safe. Even video games use physics engines to make movements look realistic.Physics also drives technology. Without physics, we wouldn’t have cars, airplanes, computers, or space exploration.It helps engineers design bridges that don’t collapse, rockets that reach space, and medical machines like X-rays and MRIs that save lives.
Biology is the study of living things. It explores how plants, animals, and humans grow, survive, and interact with their environment. Biologists study cells, genetics, ecosystems, and evolution. For example, biology explains how plants make food through photosynthesis, how animals adapt to survive in different climates, and how our bodies fight off sickness. 	
Although biology, chemistry, and physics are separate fields, they are deeply connected. Biology relies on chemistry to explain how cells function, and chemistry depends on physics to understand the behavior of atoms and energy. Together, these sciences form a complete picture of life and the universe.


Conclusion:
In conclusion, biology, chemistry, and physics are three pillars of science. Biology studies life, chemistry studies matter, and physics studies energy and the universe. Each branch answers different questions, but when combined, they help us understand the mysteries of nature and improve our daily lives. Science is not just about knowledge—it is about discovery, progress, and the endless curiosity that drives humanity forward.
